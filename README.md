# Web-Scrape
This program will monitor the Dick's Sporting Goods Website and send a discord webhook whenever a new product is added to the website.
This script was created before I learned modern scraping techniques such as requests so it is very inefficient but got the job done when I needed it. It is currently set up to monitor Jordans and Air Force 1s, will more than likely need to be updated to run correctly.

Technologies used:
Python
Selenium

How to use:
1. Fork this repo
2. Open DSG.py in your favorite python complier and add your discord webhook
3. Run DSG.py and wait for newly added products to be sent to your webhook.
